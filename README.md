# CommonUtils
This is a library which I use on many of my Android projects. It includes many useful classes to comply Material Desing standards, useful methods and more.

## Setup
The project folder is usually placed at the same level of this one, like this:

```
MyAwesomeProjects/
├── CommonUtils/
├── MyAwesomeProject/
└── AnotherAwesomeProject/
```

## Issues
If the issue is under the `com.gianlu.commonutils` package this is the right place to create the issue, if it belongs to another package email me or create an issue on the appropriate repository. 

## Versioning 
I usually edit this library from another project, therefore the commit messages might not be the most descriptive ones.
