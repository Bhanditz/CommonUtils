# CommonUtils
This is a library which I use on many of my Android projects. It includes many useful classes to complain Material Desing standards, useful methods and more.

## Versioning 
I usually edit this library from another project, therefore the commit messages might not be the most descriptive ones.

## Setup
The project folder is usually placed at the same level of this one, like this:

```
MyAwesomeProjects/
├── CommonUtils/
├── MyAwesomeProject/
└── AnotherAwesomeProject/
```
